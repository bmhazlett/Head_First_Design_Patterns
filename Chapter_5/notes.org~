* Why would you only need a single object of a class
** Thread pools, caches, dialog boxes, objects that handle preferences
** registry, objects for logging, and objecst that act as device drivers
* Why not global variables
** Singleton is a way of ensuring only one object but doesn't come with the 
** baggage of global varibles
** Global Variable Downsides
*** You will ALWAYS have them even if you don't need them

* The secret sauce of a singleton
** private constructor with static access to the constructor that will only
** call the constructor if the object had not yet already been made
